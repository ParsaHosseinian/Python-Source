# First off, let's start with the basic basics. In Python, each object /
# thing has a type. For example, a word like

print ("Hello World!") # This is a string
print (3) # This is an integer
print (4.5) # This is a float - a number with a decimal point
print ("I am", 50, "years old") # We can print multiple things by separating by commas
